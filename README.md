Deep Learning Library Written in C++

This Repository will begin with a CPU DL library written in C++ which will include Tensor Class, AutoGrad System, Operations (including Conv), Optimizers, Loss Functions
The first version of the library is not built with efficiency in mind, but rather as way to practice and understand Deep Learning algorithms further.

After I Complete this, It will be ported over to be GPU/CPU Implementation with effeciency implementations of all the algorithms written in v1. This will also probably include a rewriting of the internal Tensor Datastructure. In other words it will basically be a completely new library behind the scenes, but the forward facing methods will remain still intact.
